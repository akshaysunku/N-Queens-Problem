# Graphical Simulation of N - Queens Problem
The **N** Queens is the problem of placing **N** chess **queens** on a **N x N** chessboard so that no two **queens** attack each other i.e no two queens occupy the same **row, column or diagonal**.

This is an **N Queens** problem solver with the GUI demonstration of how the algorithm solves the problem implemented in python using the pygame library. Two search techniques **depth-first-search** and **breadth-first-search** can be used to solve and vizualise the how different algorithms approach to the solution.

### Steps to run the project 
1. Run the file `main.py` 
2. Enter the value of **N** which is the number of queens for which you wish to solve the problem.
3. Enter the delay in milliseconds for controlling the speed of simulation.
4. Choose the algorithm **depth-first-search** or **breadth-first-search** 
5. The simulation can be **PAUSED** and **RESUMED** by pressing the `SPACEBAR`.
